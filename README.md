# Azure AI services on containers samples

Azure AI services provide several Docker containers that let you use the same APIs that are available in Azure, on-premises. Using these containers gives you the flexibility to bring Azure AI services closer to your data for compliance, security or other operational reasons. Container support is currently available for a subset of Azure AI services.
Azure AI containers allow developers to use the same intelligent APIs that are available in Azure, but with the benefits of containerization.
Container services offer similar feature capabilities as the corresponding cloud service. Customers can deploy the containers on-premise. The core AI technology, pricing tiers, API keys, and API signature are the same between the container and the corresponding cloud services.
