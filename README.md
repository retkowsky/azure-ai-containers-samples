# Azure AI services on containers samples
<img src="container.png" width=300>

- **Azure AI services provide several Docker containers** that let you use the same APIs that are available in **Azure, on-premises**. Using these containers gives you the flexibility to bring Azure AI services closer to your data for compliance, security or other operational reasons. Container support is currently available for a subset of Azure AI services.<br>
- Azure AI containers allow developers to use the same intelligent APIs that are available in Azure, but with the **benefits of containerization**.
Container services offer similar feature capabilities as the corresponding cloud service. **Customers can deploy the containers on-premise**. The core AI technology, pricing tiers, API keys, and API signature are the same between the container and the corresponding cloud services. 

## Types of Containers
There are two types of container offerings: 
- **Connected containers:** keeps all the data processing locally but send the billing data to the cloud so you are charged as you use the service.
- **Disconnected containers:** enable you to use several of these APIs disconnected from the internet, with the customer making an upfront payment for a year's worth of consumption with no data sent to the cloud!
